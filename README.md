# WIP - Store

A simple desktop application that helps one keep track of belongings around their spaces, with the goal of reducing unnecessary consumption, encouraging the repurposing of unused items, etc. 

Uses the Tauri framework with a Svelte front-end, and JSON & SQLite for data persistence and simple backups.
